##  Description

Web Application for Logistics and Courier Business and Operations management.

It's a functional app that you can use to monitor, track in real-time, create, and update your courier packages, deliveries, etc.  

It has a robust API and Websocket channels setup for incoming and outgoing realtime updates and events.

You can easily build on this to create a full-fledged Real-time Logistics and Courier Business Management System, as I've taken my time to lay the foundation needed for an enterprise-grade logistics/courier app in this project.

- Routes Management: Set.
- Dependency Injection: Set.
- Modules, Repositories, Providers, Utils, Services, Values, Themes, etc: All Structure Set.
- And many more...

### This Repo:
- This Repo contains the Client Apps for Customer, Driver, and Admin. The API and the Websocket backend, are deployed on a separate [Repo](https://github.com/igefadele/logistics-api).
- Get the Clients apps (frontend apps codes) on: [Logistics/Courier API Repo](https://github.com/igefadele/logistics-api)
